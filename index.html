    <p>My Jamall Malik from North Augusta,SC.I'm a USAF Veteran in the military I was a medic. My goal is to become be an software engineer at a big four tech company. The reason I want to become a software developer is because of the flexibility to be able to work anywhere with a laptop and WI-FI. I'm hoping to learn as much as I can from Code Fellows.</p>
